Adaptive Capped Least Squares
## Description
This package includes two methods applied to minimize the adaptive resistant loss: randomized gradient descent method and gradient descent method with initials obtained from CPLEX.
Suppose we observe data vectors  $\{(x_i, y_i) \}_{i=1}^n$ that follow a linear model $y_i=x_i^{\text{T}} \beta^* +\epsilon_i, \ \ i=1,\ldots, n, $
